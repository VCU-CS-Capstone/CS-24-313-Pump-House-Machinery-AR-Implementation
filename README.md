# Pump House Machinery AR Implementation
## Friends of Pump House
## Friends of Pump House is a volunteer and restoration group conducting tours of the Neo-Gothic canal structure. The machinery in the boiler room, generator room, and pump room of the Victorian Era Pump House was broken down and sold in the 1920s. Recently, Capstone students used blueprints and photographs to model this historic machinery in 3d. An AR-ready model of the machinery on a portable tablet or viewing device is needed to provide a visualization of this registered historic building as part of a long-term restoration effort.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.
