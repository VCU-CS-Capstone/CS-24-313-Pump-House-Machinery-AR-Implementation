**Project:**  Pump House Machinery AR Implementation

**Project Description:**
Friends of Pump House is a volunteer and restoration group conducting tours of the Neo-Gothic canal structure. The machinery in the boiler room, generator room, and pump room of the Victorian Era Pump House was broken down and sold in the 1920s. Recently, Capstone students used blueprints and photographs to model this historic machinery in 3d. An AR-ready model of the machinery on a portable tablet or viewing device is needed to provide a visualization of this registered historic building as part of a long-term restoration effort.

**Problem Definition:** An AR model of the Pump House machinery is needed, because the orginal parts have sinced been removed. 

**Deliverables:** Working prototype of AR model that can be viewed on portable devices, test and evaluation evidence, and demostration.
